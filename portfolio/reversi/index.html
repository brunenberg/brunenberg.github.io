<p>&lsquo;Temple of Doom&rsquo; is a console application developed for a school assignment. The goal of making this application was to achieve a good understanding of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). I had to recreate the board game &lsquo;Reversi&rsquo;. The player(s) have to answer a few questions about the game configuration before starting. After that, it&rsquo;s just a normal game of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Reversi</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="challenges-and-solutions-">Challenges and Solutions üßóüèª</h2>
<p>Initially it was a little difficult to get a grasp on the concept of OOP (Object Oriented Programming). I understood everything that would normally be an object, should be represented by a class. But then I also needed objects like &lsquo;Game&rsquo; (one round of a match) which was confusing to me, because that is not a physical object. However, while working on my solution, I improved my understanding rapidly and I was very proud of my final product.</p>
<p>Another difficult part about this assignment, was that I had to come up with some pretty complicated algorithms (considering my level of programming knowledge at the time). Mostly for validating the input and placing the &lsquo;disks&rsquo; on the board at the right places in different directions.</p>
<p>The final important challenge I want to mention, is using the debugger. When I first used it, there were a lot of things on the screen and I was not sure what to make of all of it. I watched some video&rsquo;s about it to understand it better and soon, I understood how it worked pretty well.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-">Conclusion üèÅ</h2>
<p>This assignment laid the foundation for my OOP (Object Oriented Programming) knowledge. That is probably the single most valuable programming technology I know, and I have since gotten a lot more confortable with it. This assignment really showed me how amazing code can be. I also learned about the importance of the debugger and how to use it for finding problems in my code.</p>
