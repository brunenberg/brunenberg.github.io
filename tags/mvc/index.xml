      <description>Overview üó∫Ô∏è &amp;lsquo;Beestje Op Je Feestje&amp;rsquo; is an app we created in pairs using ASP.NET for a school project. The project mainly focused on validation rules, user authorization and authentication, unit testing, and hosting. An admin user can create animals with specific characteristics. These animals can then be rented by customers for a day, usually for parties. There are rules for choosing animals (for instance, some animals can&amp;rsquo;t be rented with certain others, based on their name or type).</description>

      <description>Overview üó∫Ô∏è &amp;lsquo;Project Bumbo&amp;rsquo; was a group project I participated in during my school days, where our team of five was tasked with solving a pressing issue for &amp;lsquo;Bumbo&amp;rsquo;, a fictional supermarket chain. The challenge at hand was the time-consuming and inefficient scheduling process that the store manager faced every week. This often resulted in employees working overtime and shifts where the store was either understaffed or overstaffed.&#xA;Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è C# ASP.</description>

      <description>Overview üó∫Ô∏è &amp;lsquo;Project Sagrada&amp;rsquo; was a school project that marked my first significant collaboration, where I worked with a team of five to eight people (it increased because of issues in one of the other groups). This project introduced me to Git and GitHub. Our objective was to develop an online version of the board game &amp;ldquo;Sagrada&amp;rdquo; using JavaFX. We followed a detailed list of requirements to ensure the game was up to the standard.</description>
