      <description>Overview üó∫Ô∏è &amp;lsquo;Beestje Op Je Feestje&amp;rsquo; is an app we created in pairs using ASP.NET for a school project. The project mainly focused on validation rules, user authorization and authentication, unit testing, and hosting. An admin user can create animals with specific characteristics. These animals can then be rented by customers for a day, usually for parties. There are rules for choosing animals (for instance, some animals can&amp;rsquo;t be rented with certain others, based on their name or type).</description>
