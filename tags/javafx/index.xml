      <description>Overview üó∫Ô∏è When school ended for the year and I had some spare time, I chose to start building a drawing/editing app using JavaFX. I had just learned about this technology and was curious to see how far I could get with this somewhat outdated technology. After setting up the basic features and tools like the pencil, brush, paint bucket, and eraser, I stopped working on the project. I decided it would be better to start exploring other technologies.</description>

      <description>Overview üó∫Ô∏è &amp;lsquo;Project Sagrada&amp;rsquo; was a school project that marked my first significant collaboration, where I worked with a team of five to eight people (it increased because of issues in one of the other groups). This project introduced me to Git and GitHub. Our objective was to develop an online version of the board game &amp;ldquo;Sagrada&amp;rdquo; using JavaFX. We followed a detailed list of requirements to ensure the game was up to the standard.</description>
